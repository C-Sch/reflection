How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I see only the lines, which have changed on the display.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can fast look on old files and can compare different versions if necessary.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    By doing it manually I can save the progress on specific key point.
    But mabye there will be to many saved versions...

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Doing programming several files are linked together -> saving multiples files ist better.
    Organising photos, each is standing alone. Here Dropbox is the better choice.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    diff doesent work.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can redo everything.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Programming with a team.
